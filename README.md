## Microsite Example

This is example code for a [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/)'s microsite tutorials:

* [Building a Map Microsite](http://mapbox.com/hosting/building-a-microsite/)
* [Making a Layer Switcher](http://mapbox.com/hosting/layer-switcher/)

It contains copies of [Wax](http://github.com/mapbox/wax) for convenience, but it's
recommended to download them on their own.

For further reference, see:

* [Modest Maps Documentation](http://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-js/wiki)
* [Wax Documentation](http://mapbox.com/wax/)
